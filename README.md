#pyStoreMan â€“ A program for managing little stores (like your stock of electronics stuff)

##License
This program is licensed under the AGPLv3. See the `LICENSE` file for more information.

##Usage
Just run the `storeman.py` file, the rest should be self-explaining.
You need a GTK runtime thingy to run this program.
You can inline-edit items by clicking on them. In case you wonder, you can only edit _places_ in the "Places" tab and only _items_ in the "Items" tab.
It's all rather rudimentary but it should be enough to keep track of your stuff. (If you're zealous enough to actually note everything down with this program, that is)

##Note
The code is really not something to be proud of, but it does the job. I wrote this in a few hours time, so don't expect a masterpiece!
